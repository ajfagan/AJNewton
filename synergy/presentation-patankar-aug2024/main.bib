  abstract = "Drug combinations are becoming a standard treatment of many
              complex diseases due to their capability to overcome resistance
              to monotherapy. In the current preclinical drug combination
              screening, the top combinations for further study are often
              selected based on synergy alone, without considering the
              combination efficacy and toxicity effects, even though these are
              critical determinants for the clinical success of a therapy. To
              promote the prioritization of drug combinations based on
              integrated analysis of synergy, efficacy and toxicity profiles,
              we implemented a web-based open-source tool, SynToxProfiler
              (Synergy-Toxicity-Profiler). When applied to 20 anti-cancer drug
              combinations tested both in healthy control and T-cell
              prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) patient cells, as well as to 77
              anti-viral drug pairs tested in Huh7 liver cell line with and
              without Ebola virus infection, SynToxProfiler prioritized as top
              hits those synergistic drug pairs that showed higher selective
              efficacy (difference between efficacy and toxicity), which offers
              an improved likelihood for clinical success.",

    abstract = "{Drug combinations have demonstrated high efficacy and low adverse side effects compared to single drug administration in cancer therapies and thus have drawn intensive attention from researchers and pharmaceutical enterprises. Due to the rapid development of high-throughput screening (HTS), the number of drug combination datasets available has increased tremendously in recent years. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive database that is crucial to both experimental and computational screening of synergistic drug combinations. In this paper, we present DrugCombDB, a comprehensive database devoted to the curation of drug combinations from various data sources: (i) HTS assays of drug combinations; (ii) manual curations from the literature; and (iii) FDA Orange Book and external databases. Specifically, DrugCombDB includes 448 555 drug combinations derived from HTS assays, covering 2887 unique drugs and 124 human cancer cell lines. In particular, DrugCombDB has more than 6000 000 quantitative dose responses from which we computed multiple synergy scores to determine the overall synergistic or antagonistic effects of drug combinations. In addition to the combinations extracted from existing databases, we manually curated 457 drug combinations from thousands of PubMed publications. To benefit the further experimental validation and development of computational models, multiple datasets that are ready to train prediction models for classification and regression analysis were constructed and other significant related data were gathered. A website with a user-friendly graphical visualization has been developed for users to access the wealth of data and download prebuilt datasets. Our database is available at http://drugcombdb.denglab.org/.}",

Since its first release in 2017, SynergyFinder has become a popular tool for multi-dose combination data analytics, partly because the development of its functionality and graphical interface has been driven by a diverse user community, including both chemical biologists and computational scientists. Here, we describe the latest upgrade of this community-effort, SynergyFinder release 3.0, introducing a number of novel features that support interactive multi-sample analysis of combination synergy, a novel consensus synergy score that combines multiple synergy scoring models, and an improved outlier detection functionality that eliminates false positive results, along with many other post-analysis options such as weighting of synergy by drug concentrations and distinguishing between different modes of synergy (potency and efficacy). Based on user requests, several additional improvements were also implemented, including new data visualizations and export options for multi-drug combinations. With these improvements, SynergyFinder 3.0 supports robust identification of consistent combinatorial synergies for multi-drug combinatorial discovery and clinical translation.}",
