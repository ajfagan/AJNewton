# Spatial Transcriptomics Endometriosis Project

(My part of the) Projected started in August 2024. 

## Design

3 groups (each with $n = 3$):

- ERaKD --- rhesus macaques with ERaKD to induce endometriosis
- Spontaneous --- rhesus macaques with spontaneously developed endometriosis
- Human --- humans with spontaneously developed endometriosis

From each sample in each group, a sample of tissue was sent to [WHERE WAS IT SENT?] for spatial transcriptomics analysis. 
Each sample contains some endometriosis tissue, and some healthy tissue.

Tasks involve
- Finding similarities and differences between spontaneous and ERaKD endometriosis.
- Finding similarities and differences between human endometriosis and that of macaques. 

Pertinent files will be stored on the biostat computers (I think? Location will be added once I know it).
