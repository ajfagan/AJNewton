  abstract={Drug combinations, offering increased therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity, play an important role in treating multiple complex diseases. Yet, our ability to identify and validate effective combinations is limited by a combinatorial explosion, driven by both the large number of drug pairs as well as dosage combinations. Here we propose a network-based methodology to identify clinically efficacious drug combinations for specific diseases. By quantifying the network-based relationship between drug targets and disease proteins in the human protein--protein interactome, we show the existence of six distinct classes of drug--drug--disease combinations. Relying on approved drug combinations for hypertension and cancer, we find that only one of the six classes correlates with therapeutic effects: if the targets of the drugs both hit disease module, but target separate neighborhoods. This finding allows us to identify and validate antihypertensive combinations, offering a generic, powerful network methodology to identify efficacious combination therapies in drug development.},

  abstract={Anti-cancer therapies often exhibit only short-term effects. Tumors typically develop drug resistance causing relapses that might be tackled with drug combinations. Identification of the right combination is challenging and would benefit from high-content, high-throughput combinatorial screens directly on patient biopsies. However, such screens require a large amount of material, normally not available from patients. To address these challenges, we present a scalable microfluidic workflow, called Combi-Seq, to screen hundreds of drug combinations in picoliter-size droplets using transcriptome changes as a readout for drug effects. We devise a deterministic combinatorial DNA barcoding approach to encode treatment conditions, enabling the gene expression-based readout of drug effects in a highly multiplexed fashion. We apply Combi-Seq to screen the effect of 420 drug combinations on the transcriptome of K562 cells using only {\textasciitilde}250 single cell droplets per condition, to successfully predict synergistic and antagonistic drug pairs, as well as their pathway activities.},

              response of two monotherapies results in that of their
              combination. We analyzed matched time course RNAseq profiling of
              cells treated with single drugs and their combinations and found
              that the transcriptional signature of the synergistic combination
              was unique relative to that of either constituent monotherapy.
              The sequential activation of transcription factors in time in the
              gene regulatory network was implicated. The nature of this
              transcriptional cascade suggests that drug synergy may ensue when
              the transcriptional responses elicited by two unrelated
              individual drugs are correlated. We used these results as the
              basis of a simple prediction algorithm attaining an AUROC of 0.77
