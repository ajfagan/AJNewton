# Notes 20 August, 24 --- Plots for Mayra's paper

## DE Gene Expression

Get a list of stat. sig. DE genes for each pairwise comparison comparison. Only 24 needed. 

Reformat the csv files to actually be comma separated. 

See if the 48 can be simply tacked onto the other plots, or if separate analysis is needed. 

### Plots

Remove 30v45 in all plots

#### num DE vs time

x-axis - time
y-axis s #DE
multiple columns per time for each treatment comparison --- don't need 30vs45

#### Heatmaps

Try 30 and 50 genes

I did sorting by $p$. Try filtering $p < 0.05$, and then sorting by log-fold change

#### Bargraphs 

Try 30 and 50 genes
 

## Pathways

Actually look into pathfindR to see if I like it


## Mice 
New data - ~12 more mice
