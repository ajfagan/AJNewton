# Notes for Spatial Transcriptomics meeting, 30 July, 2024

## Attendance

- AJ
- Nicha Boonpattrawong --- leaving at end of August for faculty position @ UW-Osh Kosh
- Manish Patankar
- Soma Banerjee --- just finished PhD, will be joining the lab starting August 1 as a postdoc. Also has an MD from India.


## Project description

Endometriosis --- can lead to ovarian cancer, but this is not a main focus of Soma's work.

Rhesus Macacs
- Model 1 --- Spontaneous 
    - They have spontaneous Endometriosis - at a rate similar to in humans, and the treatment is the same as for humans 
    - Can they be a model for human Endometriosis?
- Model 2 --- Controlled ER-alpha knockdown 
    - controlled experiment --- 6 monkeys had a knockdown of ER-alpha in hypothalamus, 6 did not 
    - We have the tissues
    - Can they be a model for human endometriosis. 
- Nicha has isolated DNA, and we have whole exome sequencing through Baylor
- Parafin-embedded slides have been sent out for spatial transcriptomic-sequencing, and has been completed.
- All data is now available. 


## Whole Exome 

Normal endometrial tissue + endometriosis + liver, 6 samples in each, minus failures
No human samples were sent. 
Some did not pass QC.
Main comparison, endometriosis vs normal within the same macaque. 

I don't need to be as involved

## Spatial 

Just endometriosis tissue. No normal.
In the data-set, there are "MP" labels, matched to those in whole exome.
3 human samples were sent. 
Samples highlighted in Yellow were done first, and then the rest were done together. 
1 ERaKD and 1 Spontaneous failed QC (high proportion of smaller fragments) --- considering bead clean up, but they think we can still get some results from it.
The ERaKD group has 2 samples fro mthe same monkey, MP14 is from a mass in the right ovary, and MP12 is on endometriosis. 

## Stick Project

We might be able to get 3 more samples due to the Stick Project. 

## Model 2 



# Also, Dan Matteson

He has somebody in his group who has done this before, in case I get stuck. 



# Another project is in the works

We are starting on the one above, but we can move into this other one once that's done. 
Precursor lesions of ovarian cancer.
