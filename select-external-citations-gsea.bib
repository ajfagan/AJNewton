   abstract={DNA microarrays can be used to identify gene expression changes characteristic of human disease. This is challenging, however, when relevant differences are subtle at the level of individual genes. We introduce an analytical strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1$\alpha$ and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis of genomic profiling experiments.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.Results: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems.Availability: ROAST is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.orgContact:  smyth@wehi.edu.auSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

  abstract = "Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway
              analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation
              category amongst the differential expression results from a
              microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene
              permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to
              inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show
              that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments
              on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model
              organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed
              based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from
              the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An
              efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene
              correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to
              control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene
              correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine
              differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows
              that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes
              in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified
              sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular
              signatures.",
