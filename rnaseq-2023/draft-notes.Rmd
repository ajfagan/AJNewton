Could you change my name from Alex J. Fagan to Alexander J. Fagan?

# Figures

My main issue with the figures is the inclusion of pairwise $p$-values such as for ULBP2/MICB in Fig 7A and CXCL8/10 in Fig 7B. 
It seems to me that, with an FDR-adjusted $p$-value greater than 0.05, a more anti-conservative threshold than I typically like to employ, there is little evidence to suggest a treatment effect, and so it doesn't seem right to go back and say "but actually it is." 
Going back and adding the $p$-values from the pairwise comparison seems, firstly, confusing --- why are there 2 different $p$-values? 
And second, and more importantly, it feels like $p$-hacking --- just choosing the model that gives us a small enough $p$-value. 
I think it would be dishonest of me to let those stay.

On a similar note, the second sentence in the second paragraph should be changed from:

> Our analysis revealed concentration and time-dependent transcriptional changes beginning at 8 hours post-treatment. The number of differentially expressed genes in atovaquone-treated OVCAR3 cells increased over time from 18 at 8 hours to 3091 at 48 hours in cells treated with IC50 and from 490 at 8 hours to 4779 at 48 hours in cells treated with IC75 concentrations. 

to (changes are in bold)

> Our analysis revealed concentration and time-dependent transcriptional changes beginning at 8 hours post-treatment. The number of *statistically significant* differentially expressed genes in atovaquone-treated OVCAR3 cells increased over time from *10* at 8 hours to *1822* at 48 hours in cells treated with IC50 and from *228* at 8 hours to *3204* at 48 hours in cells treated with IC75 concentrations. 

or

> Our analysis revealed concentration and time-dependent transcriptional changes beginning at 8 hours post-treatment. The number of *genes we determined to be differentially expressed* in atovaquone-treated OVCAR3 cells increased over time from *10* at 8 hours to *1822* at 48 hours in cells treated with IC50 and from *228* at 8 hours to *3204* at 48 hours in cells treated with IC75 concentrations. 

This change reflects the fact that we only find a gene to be statistically significantly DE in a condition if *both* the overall FDR-adjusted $p$-value, and the condition-level FDR-adjusted $p$-value are below a certain threshold ($\alpha = 0.05$).

Additionally, it elucidates that these are not necessarily *true* differentially expressed genes, but just the ones we found to be DE via our statistical model. 
Similar changes are welcome anywhere you discuss genes being DE, but it's especially important to say it once at the beginning.
